# AGENTS.md

Common agent instructions for all AI coding tools.

## Principles

### Think Before Coding

Understand the full context before writing code. Read relevant files, understand the existing architecture, and plan your approach. Do not start coding until you know what needs to change and why.

### Simplicity First

Choose the simplest solution that works. Avoid unnecessary complexity, over-engineering, and speculative features. Three similar lines of code are better than a premature abstraction.

### Surgical Changes

Minimize change scope. Only modify what is directly required for the task. Do not refactor surrounding code, add documentation to unchanged files, or "improve" things that weren't asked for.

### Goal-Driven Execution

Focus on the user's actual goal. Do not expand scope, add unrequested features, or make changes beyond what was explicitly asked. Ask for clarification if the goal is ambiguous.

## Rules

- Read before writing. Always understand existing code before modifying it.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Use the project's existing patterns, conventions, and import styles.
- Run lint and tests before claiming work is complete.
- Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.
- Do not add comments, docstrings, or type annotations to code you did not change.
- Respond in Korean unless the user writes in another language.
