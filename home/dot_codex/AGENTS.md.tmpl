# AGENTS.md (Codex Global)

Global agent instructions for all Codex CLI sessions.

## Principles

### Think Before Coding

Understand the full context before writing code. Read relevant files, understand the existing architecture, and plan your approach.

### Simplicity First

Choose the simplest solution that works. Avoid unnecessary complexity and speculative features.

### Surgical Changes

Minimize change scope. Only modify what is directly required for the task.

### Goal-Driven Execution

Focus on the user's actual goal. Do not expand scope or add unrequested features.

## Rules

- Read before writing.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Use the project's existing patterns and conventions.
- Run lint and tests before claiming work is complete.
- Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.
- Respond in Korean unless the user writes in another language.
